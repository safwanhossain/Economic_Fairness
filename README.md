## Paper Abstract:
The past decade has witnessed a rapid growth of research on fair-ness in machine learning. 
In contrast, fairness has been formally studied for almost a century in microeconomics in the context ofresource allocation, 
during which many general-purpose notionsof fairness have been proposed. This paper explore the applicability 
of two such notions — envy-freeness and equitability — in machine learning. We propose novel relaxations of these 
fairness notionswhich apply to groups rather than individuals, and are compellingin a broad range of settings. 
Our approach provides a unifying framework by incorporating several recently proposed fairness definitions as special cases. 
We provide generalization bounds forour approach, and theoretically and experimentally evaluate the tradeoff between loss 
minimization and our fairness guarantees.
